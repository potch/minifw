# minifw

A collection of little code-golfed libraries, each < 1kb minified. I think of these as a fun challenge; more compact than robust or well-documented.

use at your own risk.

- **fw.js**: baseline library for dom generation and reactivity
- **channel.js** - client and server wrappers of a Server-Sent Events channel
- **lisp.js** - an s-expression language
- **router.js** - a basic router
- **server.js** - an express-like sev
- **ssr.js** - just enough fake DOM for `fw.js` to work in non-browser contexts
